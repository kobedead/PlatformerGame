    To controll player in gamemode 1, u use  arrow keys

    To jump in gamemode2, u use SPACE

    To shoot a bullet, u use the up key

    To go back from The game to menu, you press ESC


Notes :

As coding convention i tried to use camelcase with variable(starting with lower case).
And i use camelcase with functions aswell but i mainly wrote function starting with capital letter.
Only generated functions are with lower case at begin.

I did this to differentiate a variable from a function.


Coordinate System :

i coded the game so that the left top of the displayed window is the origin (0,0)
then i just used a normal coordinate system, so the displayed area is in the 4the quadrant. (+x,-y).
So for drawing i just inversed the y coordinate.
