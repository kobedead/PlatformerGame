normally the controls are given but could be a bit confusing.


Menu :
    To browse in menu, you use arrow keys : -> , <-

    To select something in the menu, you press ENTER.

    To go back from menu you press SPACE

Game :
    To Start or to pause , u use  ENTER

    To controll player in gamemode 1, u use  arrow keys

    To jump in gamemode2, u use SPACE

    To shoot a bullet, u use the up key

    To go back from The game to menu, you press ESC


Notes :

As coding convention i tried to use camelcase with variable(starting with lower case).
And i use camelcase with functions aswell but i mainly wrote function starting with capital letter.
Only generated functions are with lower case at begin.

I did this to differentiate a variable from a function.
